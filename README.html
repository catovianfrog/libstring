<h1>LIBSTRING library</h1>

<h2>Library of string manipulating functions</h2>

<p>*v1.0Â²</p>

<p>24.06.2014    </p>

<p>This library was originally built for string functions in my <em>pca</em> statistical
program for principal component analysis. PCA is my first program written in C,
and therefore <em>libstring</em> is my first library written in this language.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS &amp; FEATURES</h2>

<h3>tokenize</h3>

<p>This function splits a string into words or substrings.
This is a small exercise to learn C. The same function in Perl would probably
take only a couple of lines of code. </p>

<p><em>Tokenize</em> returns an array of strings pointing to the words in the input buffer. The number of strings
is returned as an *int parameter passed by reference.</p>

<p>Note that the source string <strong>buffer</strong> (<em>*buf</em>) <strong>is modified:</strong> a null character is inserted at the end of each word or quoted string.</p>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p>char**    <strong>tokenize</strong>(<em>char</em> *buffer, <em>int</em> *word_count);</p>

<h3>Log History</h3>
